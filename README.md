# Games101
A code repository for learning the well-known Games 101

The homework is assumed to be done in a virtual machine 
provided along with the homework, but I use Visual Studio 2022 and 
Windows instead, so .sln files are uploaded to record my modifications.

None of the codes inside the repository is guaranteed to work
on your personal computer because of multiple reasons, for example, 
lack essential assets (which I may not store in the repository) or 
settings need to be modified.

None of the codes inside the repository is guaranteed to be 
absolutely correct, but the codes seem to produce correct output, 
which is one of the standard criteria in computer graphics to judge the 
correctness of codes.
