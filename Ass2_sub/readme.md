# Games101 Homework 2
By Schjr

This homework is done quite a long time ago, and
I do not remember the exact details of it. What
I can recall is that the triangles I rendered are
upside-down and therefore I resort to reverse the
zNear and zFar.

Such implementation is incorrect since the problem
is inherent in the left-handed coordinate system of
OpenCV and problems reveal in Homework3.
